VIM ADDON MANAGER (VAM)
=======================

VAM installs and updates additional scripts providing augmenting the feature list
of the text editor Vim.
It also handles plugin dependencies and puts each script distribution into its own directory
 resulting in a painless installation management.

Being 100% prue VimL (depending on some additional tools such as curl) it
should run everywhere. [1]

feauture list:

- declarative script management (your .vimrc):

   set runtimepath+=path-to-vam
   call scriptmanager#Activate(["snipmate","vimdevplugin", .... ])


- optional manual runtime activation of scripts:

  :ActivateAddon plugin-name


- update feature:

  :UpdateAddons [optional name list]

  This even tries to keep your local modification to achive based
  installations ! [2]


- a function which configures plugin sources:

  1) www.vim.org (the plugin list is updated once within 10 days by cron job)

  2) some scripts have been added manually. Some of them are dev versions which
     are also contained in 1)

  Contact me and I'll add additional sources.


- several maintainers & contributors providing feedback and fixing bugs.
  (Thanks to you all!) (list provided in documentation)

I could quote several people who told me how "awesome" this small tool is.
But I prefer letting you explore it yourself.

[1] most testing has been done on Linux like environments
[2] diff tools (diff and patch) required
