=====================
VAM: see *-addon-info.txt files which contains a key "depednencies"
PAT: ?

addon sources ?
===============
VAM: by plugin name. vim-addon-manager-known-repositories contains repo info.
     You can add your own sources in ~/.vimrc or by other ways easily
PAT: ?

Tags:
=====
VAM:  runs helptags automatically
PAT: has http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/gtk/0.12.0/gtk-0.12.0.tar.gz

extra dirs hacks (load files which are not loaded when adding to runtimepath only)
===================
VAM: See if !has('vim_starting') in autoload/vam.vim
PAT: I haven't seen so[urce] or ru[ntime] usage in pathogen.vim. So I guess
     this feature does not exist
