VAM = vim-addon-manager
VUN = Vundle
PAT = pathogen

PAT needs you to manually download plugins and put them inside a directory
    which pathogen will load at startup.
VUN can search http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html by name and you tell
    which names you're interested in in your .vimrc, before calling a command
    that installs them.
VAM has a repository dedicated to listing vim plugins and their dependencies,
    and is conceptually different than Vundle.

dependency management
=====================
VAM: see *-addon-info.txt files which contains a key "dependencies"
VUN: none
PAT: none

addon sources ?
===============
VAM: by plugin name. vim-addon-manager-known-repositories contains repo info.
     You can add your own sources in ~/.vimrc or by other ways easily
VUN: You can give a git url for a Bundle
PAT: You can git clone a plugin into the plugin's directory manually

=====
VAM: runs helptags automatically
VUN: runs helptags automatically
PAT: has http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/gtk/0.12.0/gtk-0.12.0.tar.gz

extra dirs hacks (load files which are not loaded when adding to runtimepath only)
===================
VAM: See if !has('vim_starting') in autoload/vam.vim
VUN: ?
PAT: I haven't seen so[urce] or ru[ntime] usage in pathogen.vim. So I guess
     this feature does not exist

VimBalls:
=========
VAM: handles them automatically
VUN: ?
PAT: need to put them in a special directory (?)

uninstallation:
===============
VAM: UninstallNotLoadedAddons
VUN: ?
PAT: delete the plugin's directory manually
